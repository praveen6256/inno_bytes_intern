## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Overview**
   - Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()` to understand the structure and distribution.
2. **Missing Value Analysis**
   - Identified missing data in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.
3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Explored distributions of categorical and numerical variables.
4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Explored survival based on sex, age, fare, passenger class, and more.
   - Used visualizations like heatmaps, boxplots, and scatterplots.
5. **Insights**
   - Found higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.
   - Younger passengers and those who paid higher fares had better chances.
